            <p>At SoilFreeze, we are dedicated to safe working environments, whether our employees are at our storage yard, at the office, or on a project site. We are proud of our impeccable safety record with the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries in successfully having no time-loss claims. Prior to each project, we review our health and safety plan in order to keep up-to-date on changing safety standards. Before we begin a project SoilFreezeâ€™s health and safety plan will meet or exceed all requirements of the general contractor or owner. All of our SoilFreeze technicians either are or can be trained and certified in the following courses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OSHA 40-hour HAZWOPER</li>
                <li>OSHA 8-hour Annual HAZWOPER Refresher</li>
                <li>Confined Space Entry</li>
                <li>Fall Protections</li>
                <li>Electrical Safety</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our method of freezing soil is both reliable and safe. We use an engineer who is an expert in soil freezing from bid until demobilization. The SoilFreeze Engineer uses data from computerized thermal analysis, plaxis structural analysis, actual soils data, site conditions, and his years of experience to create the ***BOLD***professionally stamped***BOLD*** design report. Special regard is given to project specific requirements, such as excavation dimensions and schedule. The design report then becomes our plan for installation of the freeze system and monitoring instruments. Our technicians monitor wall temperatures and examine all components of our system. Excavation will not begin until our engineer has reviewed all data and declared in writing that the wall is sufficiently formed. Once frozen, the soil is nearly as strong as concrete. Throughout this entire process, our staff is in constant communication with the engineer.</p>

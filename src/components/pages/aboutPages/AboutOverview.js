                Welcome to SoilFreeze
            </h1>
            <p>Our experience and core values of work ethic, education, and innovation are the foundation for every project. Our origins go back to the late 1980s when a group of contractors, business leaders, and academics, created a method to contain nuclear hazardous waste using freezing techniques. Since then, we have developed a broad range of soil freeze applications including foundation shoring, shaft shoring, underpinning, cofferdams, groundwater cut-off, slope stabilization, and the containment of contaminated soil and groundwater.</p>
            <p>We design, fabricate, install, and maintain customized freeze systems for each clientâ€™s needs. The installation can be designed to be maintained for a few weeks, as long as several years, or even decades.</p>
            <p>We serve both the private and public sectors and have a substantial list of successful projects and satisfied clients. SoilFreeze has advanced and refined freeze technology to create freeze systems that are mobile, reusable, and expandable to address the needs of small projects and urban locations.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I will be a collection of certification & logo images.</p>

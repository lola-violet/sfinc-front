            <p>Most shoring systems, including freezing, will work in cohesive soils with little or no ground water. Soft or non-cohesive soils, however, are extremely difficult for most shoring systems. SoilFreeze walls are appropriate for these soil types. Even soils with multiple strata form a homogenous structural wall after the strata are fused together by freezing. Cobbles, boulders, and other obstructions will freeze and become part of the structure once the freeze pipes are installed and turned on.</p>

                Shoring Completely Formed Before Excavation Begins
            </h1>
            <p>Many types of shoring require the excavation process to be delayed while internal braces, lagging, tie-backs, soil nails, or shot-crete are installed. Only after these types of shoring are installed and tested at each level can the excavation continue. In addition, internal bracing can limit access to the excavation and slow construction. SoilFreeze walls are completely formed before your excavation begins so that, once you start, you can continue until the excavation is completeâ€”no internal bracing and no excavation delays.</p>

            <p>Frozen soil shoring can be used for simple or complex excavation shapes and depths. Existing utilities do not have to be removed and rerouted but can remain in service and be simply incorporated into the frozen soil shoring wall. Foundations and large utilities can be protected from settlement or movement by frozen soil. Freeze pipes can be installed horizontally (for tunnel excavation), vertically, or any angle in between.</p>

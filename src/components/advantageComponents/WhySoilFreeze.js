            <h1>Why SoilFreeze?</h1>
            <p>The SoilFreeze system is a comprehensive alternative to other shoring methods. Ground freezing should be an option if you are considering soil nailing, soldier piles and lagging, sheet piles, caissons, slurry walls, or secant piles for your project. If your project has difficult soil conditions, many of these methods are not feasible or can have marginal success. Ground freezing can handle the most difficult soil conditions with great results.</p>
            <span>“The freezing method is remarkably versatile and, with ingenuity, it can be adapted to a great many project conditions.” </span>

            <p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):</p>
            <span>Frozen soil barriers are “environmentally benign” and have significant advantages over “conventional containment systems using steel, concrete, slurry walls, or grout curtains” and offer “extremely low maintenance costs, allowing continued use for extended periods”.</span>

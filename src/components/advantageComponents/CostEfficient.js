            <p>Our prices are competitive with all types of shoring methods, especially those that control ground water. Our goal on every project is to minimize or eliminate ground water infiltration while providing a proven, structural ground support system. A dry excavation can result in additional cost savings to the contractor and owner with regard to dewatering costs, excavation time, and material handling costs.</p>

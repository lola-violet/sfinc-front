            <p>Our system replaces other shoring systems, including sheet piles, soil nails, h-pile and lagging, caissons, secant piles, and slurry walls. Taking into account actual site and soil conditions, contractorâ€™s construction needs, live loads, earth pressures, and many other factors, each SoilFreeze system is designed and stamped by a professional engineer specifically for your project. ***BOLD***Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)***BOLD*** and their related state agencies have inspected and approved our systems and have always accepted them as the only form of shoring necessary. Inherently strong and robust, frozen soil can be nearly as strong a concrete allowing constructions of deep vertical excavated walls and circular shafts that can be hundreds of feet deep without internal bracing or "tie-backs".</p>

            <p>"Going green" is at the root of our company and has been since its creation. However, we do not provide a lesser quality product to remain "green". Our system uses the natural strength and forces of nature to overcome difficult soil conditions, naturally minimizing energy and envirmental impacts. The "LEED" (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) accreditation program is a priority for many engineers, builders, and developers. We recognize the importance of this program and we are proactive in working with our clients to meet the requirements for green building practices.</p>

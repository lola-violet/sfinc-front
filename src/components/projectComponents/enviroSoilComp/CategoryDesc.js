                SoilFreeze considers every project a “green” project. Our “green” approach provides contractors and communities with shoring and ground water cut-off that is minimally invasive and completely restores the environment to its natural state after project completion. Electric equipment is used as well as an environmentally benign freeze medium. Noise pollution is minimal and can be reduced even further by the addition of easy-to-install sound barriers. Fragile ecosystems or nearby residents are not disturbed. We eliminate excessive vibrations, reuse 90% of our material, and recycle the rest.

                We are always pleased to have the privilege of working on especially “green” projects. SoilFreeze has successfully completed projects that were designed to carefully protect such sensitive environments as a salmon creek in the Cascade foothills, the shore of Lake Tahoe, and the waters of the Yellowstone River in Montana.

                Our company roots started with the complete isolation of radioactive soil and contaminated groundwater from surrounding soils and aquifers. Addressing developing industry needs, we have expanded our technology for the isolation, removal, and replacement of soils contaminated with pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum, and many other industrial pollutants. In all our soil remediation projects, we provide protection using our frozen soil system for existing infrastructure (pipes or building footings). Complete isolation can be achieved using the innovative “zone” freezing technology we have developed and used.

            <p>It is SoilFreeze’s mission to provide the expertise and resources necessary to assist engineers and contractors in successfully completing difficult projects. Whether we are brought in during the design phase, preconstruction/bid stage, or after the project has started, we will add value and innovation. We create a safe work environment and will meet all requirements for your specific project.</p>
            <p>No project is too challenging or unique, too big or small. We work with many of the top 100 construction companies in the world, but also with single-family home builders and small municipalities.</p>
            <p>“Going green” is at the root of our company and has been since its creation. However, we do not provide a lesser quality product to remain “green.” Our system uses the natural strength and forces of nature to overcome difficult soil conditions, naturally minimizing energy and environmental impacts. The “LEED” (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) accreditation program is a priority for many engineers, builders, and developers. We recognize the importance of this program and we are proactive in working with our clients to meet the requirements for green building practices.</p>

            <h3>Customer comments - Citicentre Project in Miami</h3>
            <span>"SoilFreeze conceived and executed a very innovative method of ground freezing for cutting off groundwater during excavation for below-ground parking at our high-rise development project in downtown Miami's porous limestone.  We were very pleased with SoilFreeze and the use of ground freezing so well demonstrated during a large-scale test program at one of our sites.  Their 'zone-freeze' technology created a frozen soil plug below the excavation base that allowed the earthwork contractor do their work with minimal dewatering". </span>

                Foundations for residential and industrial applications typically have a special blend of requirements based on the unique situation of each site. Some are community and environmentally sensitive like a number of upscale residential projects on lake shores we have completed. Some are inside active industrial buildings like the Nucor steel plant in Nebraska, or the Boeing Company commercial airplane hangar in Washington.

                The versatility and non-invasive nature of our system combined with its engineered strength has allowed us to perform work in active container ship yards in Los Angeles, CA; railroad refueling yards near Oakland, CA; in the court yard of the Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital; through embankments supporting active and critical Union Pacific freight lines; and near fragile buildings at Bangor Nuclear Submarine Base on the Hood Canal.

                In all cases, the successful performance of our system was critical to the continued operation of the facilities and to the safety of the workers and the public.
